## üì• Installation

### Prerequisites:
- **ESP32 IDF v4.4** or later
- **Visual Studio Code** with ESP-IDF extension installed
- **ESP RainMaker CLI** for managing cloud configurations

### Setup Steps:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/IoT-Temperature-Humidity-Monitoring-System.git
   cd IoT-Temperature-Humidity-Monitoring-System
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Configure ESP RainMaker CLI:**
    Install the ESP RainMaker CLI:
    ```bash
    pip install esp-rainmaker-cli
    ```
    
    Log in to RainMaker:
    ```bash
   esp-rainmaker login
    ```

 4.**Build & Flash the Firmware: Set the target to ESP32 and build:**
    ```bash
    idf.py set-target esp32c3
    idf.py build
    idf.py -p PORT flash monitor  # Replace PORT with your device's COM port
    ```

 5.**Mobile App Setup:**
   *Download and install the ESP RainMaker mobile app (available for Android/iOS).*
   *Follow the on-screen instructions within the app to connect your device to the RainMaker platform.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use the Project

### Sensor Monitoring
- The system collects temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor.
- The data is transmitted to the ESP RainMaker cloud for remote monitoring.

### Voice Control via Google Assistant
By linking your RainMaker account, you can control the system and retrieve data using Google Assistant.

**Example voice commands:**
- "Hey Google, can you turn on the LED Switch?"
- "Hey Google, can you now turn off the LED."

### LED Alerts
- The Red LED will activate when the temperature or humidity exceeds a set threshold.
### üì° Over-The-Air (OTA) Updates
To update the firmware remotely:

- Use the RainMaker CLI to upload new firmware:
  ```bash
  python scripts/ota_update.py --url <FIRMWARE_URL>
  ```
